# Best Practices for n8n Workflows

This guide outlines best practices to follow when creating, maintaining, and contributing workflows to the **n8n Solutions Portfolio**. Following these guidelines helps ensure consistency, reliability, and reusability across all automation projects.

---

## 📁 Workflow Structure

- Organize each workflow under its own subfolder within `/projects`.
- Use meaningful folder and file names that reflect the use case or integration.
- Include a `README.md` in each project folder with:
  - Overview of the workflow
  - Required credentials
  - Setup instructions
  - Input/output descriptions

---

## ✍️ Naming Conventions

- Use `kebab-case` for workflow names and files.
- Prefix reusable workflows with `template-`, e.g., `template-send-email-alert`.
- Use clear, descriptive names for nodes (e.g., `Fetch User Data` instead of `HTTP Request 1`).

---

## 🔒 Security & Secrets

- Never hardcode secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens).
- Use n8n’s **Credential Manager** for handling secrets securely.
- Redact or replace credentials in example files using placeholders like `{{API_KEY}}`.

---

## 🧪 Workflow Quality

- Add error handling nodes (e.g., `IF` or `Error Trigger`) for critical steps.
- Use environment variables or global parameters where applicable.
- Test thoroughly with valid and invalid inputs before submitting.

---

## ♻️ Reusability

- Break down complex workflows into smaller, modular ones.
- Document reusable templates and explain their adaptability.
- Parameterize inputs where possible to allow customization.

---

## 📦 Version Control

- Track significant changes in the project-specific `README.md`.
- Use semantic versioning when applicable (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.).
- Tag and comment on Git commits meaningfully.

---

## 🧹 Maintenance

- Regularly review workflows for deprecated APIs or tools.
- Remove unused or test nodes before committing.
- Keep all documentation up to date with the latest changes.

---
